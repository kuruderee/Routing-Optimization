# 🧬 Evolutionary Routing Optimization (Learning Project)

> This project is a personal learning simulation developed to understand how **Genetic Algorithms** and **Reinforcement Learning (Q-Learning)** can be applied to network routing problems.

## 🎯 Purpose
I built this project to improve my algorithm skills and understand the logic behind pathfinding in complex networks. It benchmarks heuristic approaches against traditional methods like Dijkstra.

## 🚀 Features (What I Implemented)
* **Genetic Algorithm:** A basic implementation with population, crossover, and mutation logic.
* **Q-Learning Agent:** A simple agent that learns the best path through a reward/penalty system.
* **Dijkstra's Algorithm:** Used as a baseline to compare performance.
* **Simulation:** A console-based simulation to test 50x50 node networks.

## 🛠 Tech Stack
* **Language:** Java (Core)
* **Testing:** JUnit 5 (Used for basic validation)
* **IDE:** Eclipse

## 📈 What I Learned
* How to model a problem for evolutionary algorithms.
* The importance of "Island Model" to prevent premature convergence (basic implementation).
* How to write unit tests for algorithmic logic.

## ⚠️ Disclaimer
This is an **ongoing learning project**. The code is open to optimization and improvements.
